This repo provides the matlab code for the validations of our Affine EKF framework on three SLAM applications with different type of features, typical point features, plane constrained point features and plane features.

In each folder for an application, run **Main.m** to implement the Monte Carlo simulations.
All the compared algorithms are implemented by ourselves.

In this paper, we also prove some sufficient and necessary conditions between the state independent unobservable subspace and observability constraint for consistency.
